My sample app called SportsList made with siwft without storyboard, because in my opinion that way is more confortable for future upgradeof the app or the desing of Iphone. 
SportsList retrieves the sports list thank to one API delegate that call API async with to two escaping (one for completition and one for failure).
It will show the result, when the date are ready, in a vertical simple list with sport names for each row; while the list are waiting for data appear an allert for loading the data from database.
If an user press on a row, a navigatore controll show an other pages with details of the selected sport like match duration time of match and numer of match.
I used alamofire for the api because in my opinion is better than the afnetworking.
